# TozmicMob
mobs


In this plugin, there is a 5% chance for a naturally spawning polar bear with a custom name tag to spawn in the world. The polar bear spawning is coded to not overload or cause performance drops.
The polar bear also has custom attack pathfinders that are different from the regular built in minecraft capabilities. The polarbear with the custom name will attack one without it. 

Additionally, few other features are added to aid server owners/admins. Permissions are included to restrict usage to commands.
